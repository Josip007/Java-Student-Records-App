# Java-Student-Records-App

Create an application for student records that will consist of two classes: Student and Record.
The Student class will contain the following attributes:
1. Name (String), Surname (String), Year of study (int), Index number (String)
The Student class should have a constructor for setting all attributes, as well as getters and setters for each attribute.
The Record class should contain the following attributes:
1. List of students (ArrayList<Student>)
The Records class should contain methods for:
1. Adding a student, Searching a student by index number, Printing all students
In the main method (main) you need to enable the entry of students, search and printing of students using the Scanner class.
General tips for the task:
1. Start by creating the Student class and adding attributes and methods.
2. Next, create a Record class with an attribute to store the list of students and methods to work with the list.
3. In the main method, use Scanner to enter student data and work with the Records class. 4. Don't forget about while, for and switch!
5. Test the application with different scenarios to make sure everything works as it should.
